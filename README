README for the Target Configs

If modifying these target configurations, pay special attention to the JTAG clk freq.  This was the main headache when trying to get them working.

Each Channel (1-4) & the Master DSP has its own config because it's the config for the entire system with that Channel's DSP selected for usage.


Add these target configs to the projects in order to program that certain DSP.
