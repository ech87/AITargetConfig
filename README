README for the Target Configs

THese took forever to friggin figure out because of the JTAG clk freq.

Each Channel (1-4) & the Master DSP has its own config because it's the config for the entire system with that Channel's DSP selected for usage.

Add these target configs to the projects in order to program that certain DSP.
